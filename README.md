# SCChallengeEmailID
The first of the Space Cadet challenges for 2021 at SOTON

I have come from exclusivley programming in Python and have been learning Java for the past 2 weeks, because of this I chose to go one of the easier routes by using the JSoup library.

# What Could I Do Next?

 - I believe my code is expandable so I could add features such as also returning the phone number associated with the email ID
 - The next extension for me would be to write it in base Java so that I can further understand what is possible in Java
 - The other feature I could add with my current implementation is accessing the secure site through manipulation of cookies.
